# BBMP Borewell Dashboard — IISc for BWSSB

An interactive dashboard for exploring BBMP's 198 wards and the borewell sensors reporting inside them. Built for the Indian Institute of Science team to hand over to BWSSB.

- **Live URL** (once deployed): https://\<your-user\>.github.io/bbmp-borewell-dashboard-iisc/
- **Codebase**: static HTML/JS/CSS (this repo). Two data modes: (a) read `data/*.json` shipped with the site, or (b) call a Cloudflare Worker + D1 API. Switch via `js/config.js`.
- **Cost**: free at current scale (GitHub Pages + Cloudflare Workers free tier + D1 free tier).

If you're brand new here, **read [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md) first** — it walks through viewing locally, publishing to GitHub Pages, and refreshing data.

## Architecture at a glance

Two swappable data modes, one frontend:

```
                            Static mode (default)
                            ─────────────────────
     ┌────────────┐   fetch ┌───────────────┐
     │  Browser   │────────>│ GitHub Pages  │──> serves data/*.json directly
     └────────────┘         └───────────────┘

                            API mode (Cloudflare + D1)
                            ─────────────────────────
     ┌────────────┐   fetch ┌────────────────┐  SQL   ┌───────┐
     │  Browser   │────────>│ Cloudflare Wkr │───────>│  D1   │
     └────────────┘         └────────────────┘        └───────┘
              (js/config.js chooses which)
```

The static mode has zero moving parts and is fine while total data stays under a few hundred MB. The API mode scales to years of historical data on Cloudflare's free tier (5 GB D1, 100k Worker requests/day) and is the path for when you want the dashboard to answer live queries.

## Where the data comes from

- **Raw source**: KH Projects sends a cleaned Excel ZIP (e.g. `borewell_water_level_200826.zip`) with one .xlsx per sensor for the current reporting window (currently 15 Jul – 20 Aug 2026, 579 sensors).
- **Ward boundaries**: BBMP's `bbmpwards.zip` shapefile (198 wards, sits in the sibling `bbmp-borewell-dashboard` repo).
- **Population / area**: `population_source.xlsx` in the sibling `bbmp-borewell-backend/exports/`.
- **Motor HP / borewell depth / full sensor list**: your Neon Postgres `sensors` table, populated by the existing `sync_kh_device_metadata.py` script that scrapes KH.

`backend/prepare_data.py` orchestrates all of the above and writes the JSON files under `data/`.

## Session quality and dashboard inclusion

Sessions start at any cumulative-yield decrease or a time gap above 30 minutes.
All readings and sessions are retained, including single-reading sessions and
sessions with missing water-level endpoints. The four KH flags are fewer than
3 readings, no yield advance, a water-level step above 20 ft, and negative
endpoint drawdown. Zero drawdown is not a net level rise. Missing water/yield
readings are additional dashboard checks.

The following inclusion policy is our dashboard interpretation, not a claim
that KH deletes these sessions:

- **OK**: no quality flags.
- **Flagged**: requires review, including possible re-lock and net level rise.
- **Excluded from default analysis**: fewer than 3 readings, missing/nonpositive
  endpoint volume, or missing endpoint water level. Still visible and downloadable.

Eligibility is separate from status. Volume requires at least two readings,
complete yield readings and positive yield advance. Drawdown requires at least
three readings, complete levels, no >20 ft jump and positive endpoint drawdown.
Specific-capacity eligibility requires both. An excluded two-reading session can
still have measurable volume. Eligibility is a screening decision, not calibration
or proof that a sensor measurement is accurate. No automatic corrections occur.

The sensor table lists every session, reasons, observed values and eligible
calculations, with pagination and CSV download. All retained sessions are shown
initially; the selector can show OK only, flagged only, or excluded only in the
table and charts. Counts cover the full history; chart range buttons only limit
chart dates. Chart colours indicate session status. Discharge comes directly
from flow_lpm, not water level or yield differences; flow accuracy is not separately
validated. Yield-counter problems do not establish that discharge is zero.

`backend/session_quality.py` is the versioned policy shared by the build and the
JSON refresh. `js/session-quality.js` provides a tested equivalent fallback for
older data/API responses. Backend annotations take precedence at matching version.
Run `python backend/refresh_session_quality.py` to refresh the existing snapshot
without rereading the Excel ZIP. It verifies raw arrays remain unchanged and writes
`data/session_quality_summary.json`. Run `python backend/test_session_quality.py`
for policy and backend/browser parity tests.

## Dashboard behaviour

- Full-screen map on load; **no sidebars**. Toolbar (top-right) has search / filters / about.
- Wards choropleth-shaded by sensors-with-data. Toggle in Filters to shade by total sensors or population.
- 579 sensors visible by default. Bottom-right toggle reveals no-data sensors (once `sensors_db_extract.py` has run, this includes KH's full inventory beyond the 579).
- Hover a ward → tooltip (population, area, sensor counts).
- Click a ward → right-side panel with stats + full UID list. Click a UID → jumps to that sensor.
- Click a sensor → metadata (ward, motor HP, depth, first/last reading, reading count) + two charts (water level, discharge). Each chart has 1W / 1M / 3M / All range chips and an expand button for a full-window view.
- Search (Ctrl-K or the magnifier icon): ward name, ward number, or UID. Quick views: top / bottom / no-sensor wards.

## Publishing & refreshing

Both flows are one push. Full commands in [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md).

```
# refresh data snapshot
cd backend && python sensors_db_extract.py && python prepare_data.py

# publish
cd ..
git add . && git commit -m "Refresh snapshot" && git push
# GitHub Actions deploys to Pages in ~1 minute
```
